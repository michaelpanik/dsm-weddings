Generally, we put together custom packages per-wedding including a full day highlight, full ceremony cut, receptions, rehearsal dinners, and anything else you might want filmed. Our most popular options are highlight film only, and highlight + full ceremony."

We'll be in communication about the timeline of the wedding day. The day of, we'll arrive on time and go to work, filming all around the action for as long as we've agreed upon. The editing process for highlight films takes four to five weeks, including a 60 second teaser video two weeks after your wedding. The ceremony cut will come later, and usually takes around a week."

If your new date is available, we'll block it for you, no problem. If you need to change the date of your wedding, let us know and we'll work it out together."
