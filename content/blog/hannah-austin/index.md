Creating memories of people’s big day is already our favorite thing to do - those people being our friends just sweetens the deal! This was easily one of the most unique weddings we’ve ever been a part of. It wasn’t just the beautiful 150 year old house; with only about 20 guests, this was a truly special day for Austin, Hannah and everyone that had the joy of being there. My favorite part of this video is the original song “The Best Line”, performed by the groom, which beautifully frames their love story.
