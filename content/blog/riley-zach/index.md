Even though there's often a lot of stress and waiting that goes into that big day, a wedding should ultimately be one thing: fun. This wedding was nothing but fun! Riley and Zach couldn't stop smiling the whole day. Their love was tangible, and the joy of their friends and family filled every moment at Matthews Manor in Springville, AL. It's videos like these that remind us how privileged we are to do what we do, and we hope you enjoy it as well.
