Itâ€™s always a beautiful day at The Bell House in Heflin, AL. The beautiful farmland in the heart of Alabama creates a perfect backdrop for the love story of Erin and Wesley. Capturing this day was nearly effortless, as their love and joy shown through every frame! On top of a gorgeous day, grand venue, and lovely couple, the lush flower arrangements done by the mother of the groom topped off the grandeur. We hope you enjoy watching as much as we did creating!\
