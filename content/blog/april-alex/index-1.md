description: "Small weddings are often the most special and intimate kind. The
  wedding of April and Alex was just that: a gorgeous union of two people,
  completely in love, surrounded by their closest friends and family. The day
  was serene and peaceful, fully focused on love and life ahead, all
  complimented by the beautiful scenery of Trinity United Methodist Church in
  Homewood, AL. It was a pleasure creating this sweet video and we hope that you
  love it."
